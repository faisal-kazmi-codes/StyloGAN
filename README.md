* Both Linux and Windows are supported. Linux is recommended for performance and compatibility reasons.
* 64-bit Python 3.6 installation. We recommend Anaconda3 with numpy 1.14.3 or newer.
* We recommend TensorFlow 1.14, which we used for all experiments in the paper, but TensorFlow 1.15 is also supported on Linux. TensorFlow 2.x is not supported.
* On Windows you need to use TensorFlow 1.14, as the standard 1.15 installation does not include necessary C++ headers.
* One or more high-end NVIDIA GPUs, NVIDIA drivers, CUDA 10.0 toolkit and cuDNN 7.5. To reproduce the results reported in the paper, you need an NVIDIA GPU with at least 16 GB of DRAM.
